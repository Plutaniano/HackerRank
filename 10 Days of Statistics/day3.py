##Challenge 1
# There are 4 possible combinations of 2 children:
# [B, G], [G, B], [B,B], [G, G]
# [G, G] doesn't count, because there are no boys
# so the probability of [B, B] is 1/3

##Challenge 2
# A deck of card has 52 cards, 13 of each of the 4 suits
# You draw a card of suit X from the deck
# so there are 12 cards of suit X left in the deck and the deck has now 51 card
# so the chance of drawing another suit X card is 12/51

##Challenge 3
# 3/7 of marbles are red
# 4/7 of marbles are blue
# you draw a red marble
# so now the chances of a red and blue marble are respectively 2/6 and 4/6
# 4/6 = 2/3
